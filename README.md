## Front End Program

- In the front end program, we are learning about JavaScript. Our first project involved unit testing functions to see if they performed the actions that our test's dictated that they should. Our functions involved things such as arrays, objects, for loops, conditionals, etc. How is the back end program going so far?

### Git Command Practice

- Command ran for creating new branch:  git checkout -b feature/adding-text-to-README.md
